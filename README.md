# Road-Crash-Causation-Chain-Dataset
**Overview**

This dataset is curated using the Driving Reliability and Error Analysis Method (DREAM), based on the National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey (NMVCCS) database. It contains 2,000 crash cases, each manually validated for accuracy. The dataset is designed for training large language models (LLMs) on crash causation inference tasks, providing a standardized corpus for analyzing and understanding crash causation chains in road safety contexts.

**Dataset Components**

Number of Cases: 2,000 crash cases

Source: NMVCCS (National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey)

Methodology: Curated using the Driving Reliability and Error Analysis Method (DREAM)

Validation: All cases manually reviewed for accuracy

**Purpose**

This dataset is intended for:

Training large language models (LLMs) on crash causation inference

Analyzing and understanding crash causation chains in road safety

Assisting in safety engineering and crash causation analysis

**Usage**

The dataset will be made available after the acceptance of the associated paper. It is currently under review, and the link to download the dataset will be provided once the paper is published.
